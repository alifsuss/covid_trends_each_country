# covid_trends_each_country
This R script automates the COVID-19 data collection from https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu and plot chronological cases and deaths
In the script, you can see that I specified the country to Indonesia with country code: "ID"
However you can modify them to any "XX" country code that you want for example: "US" and you will be able to see the covid trends for the US! (dont forget to change the title!)
  - I have put an example for the USA as well
Hopefully this pandemic will end soon!
Stay safe!
